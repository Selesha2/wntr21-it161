            <h2><center>Social Media Optimization (SMO)</center></h2>
              <p>When creating a website, one of your main goals is to have as many users as possible see and use your site. You do your best at designing each page to be user friendly so people want to come back for more and share with their friends. The best way to spread the word around and grow your online presence is by social media optimization (SMO). “Social media usage is one of the most popular online activities. In 2020, over 3.6 billion people were using social media worldwide, a number projected to increase to almost 4.41 billion in 2025.” <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/">(Tankovska, 2021)</a> With all of these people using social media, your best bet to optimizing the traffic coming through your site is by creating multiple audiences on various different social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter. Once you create these accounts for your website, you can start building your social media profiles and start sharing content. “One of the biggest mistakes that companies make is not making the most of the available space on their social profiles. Many companies rush through this process to get their pages launched and leave certain forms blank.” <a href="https://www.webfx.com/social-media/social-optimization.html">(WebFX, 2021)</a> These profiles are your chance at really explaining what your company is about and providing as much information as possible to get people interested in who you are.  In creating all these accounts connected to your site, you will also improve your search engine optimization as well. This is similar to SMO but instead when specific keywords that relate to your website are typed into search engines like Google, your website along with all your social media accounts will be the first links the users will see. 
There are so many other ways of taking advantage of social media to boost your business such as adding in share buttons around your site, personally thanking those who do hit the share button, and posting content daily or on some kind of schedule. You want to be loud and up front and let people know you hear them too.
